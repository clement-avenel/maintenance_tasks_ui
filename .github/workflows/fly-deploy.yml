# Deploys the dummy app (spec/dummy) to Fly.io. Config: spec/dummy/fly.toml; build from root so the gem is in context.
# See https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/
# One-time: create the app (fly launch . -c spec/dummy/fly.toml --no-deploy from repo root). Add FLY_API_TOKEN secret.
